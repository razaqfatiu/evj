This is a EV journey planner application for my M.Sc project.
As a result of recent laws and regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a greener solution, vehicle users are increasingly adapting to the use of electric vehicles for all types of journeys.  Due to these vehicles' limited battery capacities require frequent stops at charging stations, which must be factored into route planning to avoid inefficient vehicle routes or stranded EVs. 
This project introduces an electric vehicle journey planner (EVRP) for passenger cars that allows for single or multiple recharging stops along the way. 
The increased adaptability of EVs, as well as the need for a convenient and straightforward method of trip planning with electric vehicles that do not require extensive time and energy, spent calculating stopping and charging times and locations, are the driving forces behind this project.
This project will help people overcome their fear of the limited range and charging inconveniences associated with electric vehicles on long journeys while also contributing to the decarbonisation transition.
Aim and Objectives
The aim of this project is to create a web-based application that assists electric vehicle users in planning longer-distance trips. 
The solution will take into account the limited range of the EV, battery's state of charge, the distance and duration of the trip, the charging infrastructure available, and the charging duration to determine a route from start to end, an itinerary with planned stops, and the estimated charging duration to spend at each charging station to optimise the journey's duration.
